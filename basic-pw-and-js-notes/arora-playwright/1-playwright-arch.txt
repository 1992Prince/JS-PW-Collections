‚úÖ Playwright vs Selenium: Architecture Explained

üîπ Playwright Architecture (Uses WebSocket)

Playwright follows a Client‚ÄìServer architecture with communication done via the WebSocket protocol, 
which is faster and persistent compared to HTTP.

	Client: Can be Java, JavaScript, Python, or C# based test code.

	Server: Playwright Server which controls the browsers.

	Browsers: Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and WebKit (Safari engine).

How it works:

The client (e.g., Java or Python test script) initiates a connection to the Playwright server via WebSocket.
Once the connection is established (called a handshake), it remains open.
Multiple test commands (requests) and their corresponding responses flow through the same persistent connection.
The Playwright server executes the commands directly on the target browser.

Advantages of WebSocket:
Low latency and high speed: Unlike HTTP, there's no need to re-establish a connection after every request.
Real-time communication: Ideal for sending rapid, consecutive commands.
Less flaky: Since connection remains open, chances of failure due to connection drops are reduced.

üîπ Selenium Architecture (Uses HTTP)

Selenium also uses a Client‚ÄìServer model, but it communicates over the HTTP protocol.

	Client: Selenium test scripts written in Java, Python, C#, etc.

	Server: Selenium Server / WebDriver.

	Browsers: ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver (Firefox), etc.

How it works:

Each test command(client code) is sent from the client to the Selenium server as an individual HTTP request.
The server processes it, interacts with the browser, and sends back the response.
After every request-response cycle, the connection is terminated.
A new connection is created for the next command.

Drawbacks of HTTP:

Slower performance: Every test command requires a new connection.
Higher flakiness: Repeated connect/disconnect cycles increase the chance of flaky tests.
Not real-time: Commands are queued, adding delays between actions.

‚öñÔ∏è Summary: WebSocket vs HTTP in Test Automation

Feature	             Playwright (WebSocket)	          Selenium (HTTP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protocol	             WebSocket	                       HTTP
Connection	      Persistent (single connection)	Re-established for each request
Speed	                 Faster	                          Slower
Reliability	      High (less flakiness)	           Lower (more flaky due to repeated handshakes)
Language Support	Java, Python, JS/TS, C#	        Java, Python, JS, C#, Ruby, etc.
Browser Control	  Chromium, Firefox, WebKit	        Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

Note - Prince u know execution time is less if u r using playwright and will be more if u r using selenium.
       In Orion already you have seen it.


üéØ Interview-Friendly Summary
"Playwright uses a WebSocket-based architecture which enables persistent, high-speed communication between the client and the Playwright server. 
This makes it faster and more reliable than Selenium, which uses HTTP where the connection is recreated for every request. 
As a result, Playwright offers better performance, less flakiness, and supports modern browser features like handling popups and 
multiple tabs more effectively."
