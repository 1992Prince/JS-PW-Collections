Loops - the way of repeating lines of codes until the loop condition is met

While loop
Do-while loop
For Loop
Nested loop
ForEach

while  ---> when the number of iterations are unknown

Nesting of loops

The placing of one loop inside the body of another loop is known as nesting of loops

while working with nesting loops the outloop will change only when the inner loop is 
completely finished
