/*
Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform arithmetic operations on numbers.

Operator	 Description	    Example	        Result
+	         Addition	        5 + 2	         7
-	         Subtraction	    5 - 2	         3
*	         Multiplication	    5 * 2	         10
/	         Division	        5 / 2	         2.5
%	        Modulus (Remainder)	5 % 2	         1
++	         Increment      	let x = 5; x++ 	 6
--	         Decrement	        let x = 5; x--	 4
*/


let a = 5;
let b = 2;
let c = a + b;
console.log("c - ", c); // 7

console.log()

/*
2. Assignment Operators
These are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	  Description	         Example	     Result
=	          Assign	             x = 5	         x = 5
+=	          Add and Assign	     x += 2	         x = x + 2
-=	         Subtract and Assign	 x -= 2	         x = x - 2
*=	         Multiply and Assign	 x *= 2	         x = x * 2
/=	         Divide and Assign	     x /= 2        	 x = x / 2
%=	         Modulus and Assign    	 x %= 2	         x = x % 2
*/

/*
3. Comparison Operators
These are used to compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false).

Operator	      Description	                Example	       Result
==	        Equal (loose equality)	            5 == "5"      	true
===	        Strictly equal (strict equality)	5 === "5"	   false
!=	              Not equal	                    5 != "5"	   false
!==	         Strictly not equal	                5 !== "5"	   true
>	         Greater than	                    5 > 2	       true
<	         Less than	                        5 < 2	       false
>=	        Greater than or equal to	        5 >= 5	       true
<=	        Less than or equal to	            5 <= 4	       false



4. Logical Operators
These are used to combine multiple conditions or expressions.

Operator	 Description	            Example	         Result
&&	         Logical AND	            true && false	  false
||		     Logical OR                 true || false	  true
!	         Logical NOT	            !true	          false


6. Ternary Operator
This is a shorthand for if-else statements.

Operator	Description	                    Example	                    Result
? :	         Condition, if true : if false	let x = (5 > 2) ? 10 : 20	10
