Explain below code:

declare global {
    namespace PlaywrightTest {
        interface Matchers<R> {
            shouldEqual(expected: any): R;
        }
    }
}

and Y it is needed?

I created custom expect with name shouldEqual but when I use it in tests it was throwing red color error
i.e.

Property 'shouldEqual' does not exist on type '{ not: MakeMatchers<void, any, {}>; resolves: MakeMatchers<Promise<void>, any, {}>; rejects: MakeMatchers<Promise<void>, any, {}>; } & ... 6 more ... & SnapshotAssertions'.

So to avoid this error and fix it we added above code in custom-expect.ts file
