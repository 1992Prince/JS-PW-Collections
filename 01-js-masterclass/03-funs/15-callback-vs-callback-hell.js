/**
Interviewer: “Can you explain what a callback is? And what is callback hell?”

🔹 Callback

  - A callback is simply a function that is passed as an argument to another function, 
    and then executed after some operation or event is completed.

  - Callbacks are a fundamental part of JavaScript, used for both synchronous (immediate) 
    and asynchronous (delayed) operations.

  - It’s a fundamental concept in JavaScript, used to make code non-blocking.


🔹 Callback Hell

  - Callback Hell is what happens when multiple callbacks are nested inside each other, 
    usually because one async task depends on the result of another.

  - This causes:
     - Deep nesting (rightward indentation)
     - Messy, unreadable code
     - Difficult debugging and error handling

  - It’s not a concept, but a problem pattern that occurs when callbacks are misused or overused.
