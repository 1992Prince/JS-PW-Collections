/**
 * 📝 Assignment Task
 *
 * 🎯 Objective:
 *   Demonstrate handling asynchronous tasks in JavaScript using:
 *     1. Callback functions
 *     2. Promises
 *     3. Async/Await
 *
 * 🔧 Task Description:
 *   - Simulate fetching user data from a server (2 second delay).
 *   - The operation should randomly succeed or fail.
 *   - On success, return: { name: "Amit", age: 25 }
 *   - On failure, return: "Failed to fetch data"
 *
 * ✅ Requirements:
 *   1. Implement using a callback: callback(error, data)
 *   2. Refactor using Promises with .then() and .catch()
 *   3. Rewrite using async/await with try...catch for error handling
 *   4. Briefly mention benefits and drawbacks of each approach
