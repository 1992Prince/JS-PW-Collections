2️⃣ How to Run in VS Code with Live Server

Install VS Code (if not already installed).

Open VS Code and create a folder named playwright-practice.

Inside that folder, create a file named locators-practice.html and paste the above HTML code.

Install Live Server extension in VS Code:

Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X), search "Live Server", and install it.

Right-click on locators-practice.html → "Open with Live Server".

It will open in your default browser at a URL like:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/locators-practice.html

Now you can use Playwright to write tests targeting this local page.
