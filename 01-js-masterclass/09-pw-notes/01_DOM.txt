📌 What is the DOM?

    Full form: Document Object Model
    Definition: A live in-memory tree structure that the browser creates from your HTML page.
    Purpose: Allows JavaScript to read, modify, add, or delete elements on a webpage.

    Browser HTML source code padhta hai aur uska ek memory me model banaata hai — isko hi DOM bolte hain.

📌 What is a Node?

Every HTML element, attribute, and piece of text is a node in the DOM tree.
Types of nodes:
    - Element Node: <div>, <p>, <h1>
    - Attribute Node: id="header", class="main"
    - Text Node: "Hello World"

📌 Child Nodes

Nodes that are inside another node.
Example:

    <ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
    </ul>

    <ul> → parent node
    <li> elements → child nodes of <ul>

📌 HTML vs DOM

| HTML                               | DOM                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Static source code from the server | Browser’s live, updated structure  |
| Stored in a file                   | Stored in memory                   |
| Cannot change without reloading    | Can be changed live via JavaScript |


📌 Live Changes in DOM with JavaScript

document.getElementById('title').innerText = 'Updated Title';

Updates the DOM tree instantly
The change is visible on the webpage immediately (no refresh needed)

📌 Interview-Ready Answer - What is DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a live tree structure that browsers create from HTML pages. 
Each element, attribute, and text is represented as a node. 
JavaScript can interact with the DOM using methods like getElementById() and querySelector(), 
allowing us to change the webpage content and structure dynamically. While HTML is static, 
the DOM represents the browser’s current, updated view of the page.

📌 SID Notes on DOM

What is the DOM?
- The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programmatic interface that browsers create to 
  represent the structure and content of a webpage.
- Think of it as an in-memory tree structure where each HTML element, attribute, and 
  piece of text is a node.

🟡 Key Facts:

Tree-like hierarchy: The <html> tag is the root node, with <head> and <body> as children, 
                      and so on.


Live representation: The DOM updates in real time if JavaScript changes the page 
                    (e.g., document.getElementById('btn').innerText = "Clicked!" 
                    updates both the DOM and what you see).
                    Eg: document.querySelector('button').innerText = 'Submit';

APIs to interact with it: JavaScript can read or modify the DOM via methods like:

document.querySelector('#login'); 
document.getElementById('username').value = 'testUser';

Different from HTML source: The HTML source is static; the DOM is what the browser currently sees, 
                            which may be altered by scripts.

📌 Why DOM Matters in Playwright

In Playwright automation, everything revolves around the DOM’s live structure — this is where elements are located, interacted with, and verified.
If you understand DOM behavior well, you can write stable, maintainable, and non-flaky tests.

🧠 1. Element Identification

    Playwright locators target elements based on the current DOM tree.

    Example: await page.locator('form#login button[type="submit"]').click();


💡 2. Write Robust Selectors

    🟡 Warning: Avoid brittle selectors that break if an id changes.
    🟢 Use hierarchy-based CSS selectors or text locators when attributes are dynamic.

    await page.locator('nav >> text=Home').click();


⏳ 3. Handle Dynamic Content

🔵 SPAs (React, Angular, Vue) update DOM without a full page reload.

🟢 Playwright’s auto-wait feature detects DOM stability before performing actions — no manual 
    sleep() needed.


🕒 4. Wait for the Right DOM State

    🟢 Always wait for elements before interacting:

    await page.locator('#submit').waitFor({ state: 'attached' });
    await page.locator('#submit').click();

    📌 Possible states:

        - attached (exists in DOM)
        - visible (shown on screen)
        - hidden (in DOM but not visible)
        - detached (removed from DOM)

🔍 5. Debug Element Issues

    When Playwright says "element not found":

    🧠 Check Chrome DevTools (Inspect Element) for:

        ❗ Is it inside an iframe?
        ❗ Hidden via CSS?
        ❗ DOM changed after page load?

🧾 6. Avoid Flaky Tests

    🟡 Clicking before the element appears = test failure.

    🟢 Correct approach: await page.waitForSelector('#message');
