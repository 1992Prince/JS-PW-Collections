What does skip do in below test

    test('has title', async ({ page, browserName }) => {

        test.skip(browserName === 'firefox', 'Still working on it');
        await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
    
        //await page.waitForTimeout(40000); // wait for 40 secs
        // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
        await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Plapqweywright/);
    
    
    
        // Create timestamp
        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:]/g, '-').replace('T', '_').split('.')[0];
        await page.screenshot({ path: `screenshots/example_${timestamp}.png`, fullPage: true })
    });
