Timeouts in PW have 3 layers design and dependency.

Outer Layer is Global Timeouts:
-------------------------------------------------------

Global timeout is the time limit of the whole test run.

It means that if you have multiple tests, let's say ten tests in your test suite, global timeout is
the total duration of the time for the entire test run execution.

If the global timeout, for example, set for two minutes and if your entire test suite runs longer
than two minutes, then the test will be terminated based on the timeout by default.

By default Global timeout is not configured and if you want to configure it, you absolutely can do this.

We can specify global timeout in pw.config.ts file i.e.

export default defineConfig({

    timeout: 20000,
  
    globalTimeout: 90000,


The next layer of the timeout is a - test timeout, which is under a global timeout test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timeout is the time limit for a single test execution.

The default value for the timeout is 30s or 30,000 milliseconds and you can configure this value accordingly.

U can configure it in config.ts file also for all tests in framework
U can configure at test level also [Prince find multiple ways to set it up]

And inside of the test timeout there is a nested three other timeouts[Action timeout, Navigation timeout and Expect timeout] 
which is action timeout navigation

In playwright.config.ts file we specified test timeout 10000 ms and now if inside any test if any click is taking
more that 10000 ms then after 10000 ms script will failed with error - target is closed
bcoz here test timeout specified is 10000 ms and test execution can't go beyond this time

export default defineConfig({

    timeout: 10000,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action and Navigation Timouts we can specify below in use section of config.ts file

use: {
    /* Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`. */
    // baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',

    /* Collect trace when retrying the failed test. See https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer */
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    actionTimeout: 5000,
    navigationTimeout: 5000
  },


- Action Timeout

Action Timeout is the time limit for the action command to be executed.
For example, if we take the click command, the click command will wait for element to be available,
visible, clickable and so on up to the time of the test timeout because action timeout by default is
not configured.

If you will configure the action timeout, click for example, will wait up to the configuration timeout
of the action.

Timeout action timeout cannot be longer than the test timeout and test timeout cannot be longer than
a global timeout.

If you put for example action timeout of 40s but test timeout is configured as 30s, the actual action
timeout will be 30s because it will be limited by the layer of the test timeout and by default action
timeout is also not configured.

1 case: by default test timeout is 30 secs and we haven't specified action timeout in config file
        then action timeout will wait for test timeout for performing action like click

2 case: by default test timeout is 30 secs and we specified action timeout of 5 secs in config file
        then all actions methods in framework like click etc will wait for max 5 secs for elements to visible, clickable etc 
        and then perform click and if element is not visible/clickable etc in 5 secs then it will throw the error.

        Note: In framework this action timeout will be common for all action mehtods for all tests and for all spec file

3 case: by default test timeout is 30 secs and we specified action timeout of 5 secs in config file 
        and but still for some specific step action like click() element is taking longer time to load and for this specific case
        u can just increase action timeout by: await successButton.click({timeout: 16000})
        So only for this action click action time is overriden from 5 secs to 16 secs.

        but this step should be completed within test timeout bcoz it will not override test timeout and action timeout
        is subset of test timeout

4 case: by default test timeout is 30 secs but u given test timeout in cofig as 60 secs i.e. 60000 ms
        Now in some specific test we have one element that loading takes more than 20 secs and so test execution time gets icreased
        so u want to just increase timeout for specific test and not all tests in framework,
        This can be done by:
        test("test name", async ({page})={
            test.setTimeout(120000);
        })
        and now this test got 2 mins to complete its execution and all action methods like click will take this test timeout
        and we don't need to give action timeout, until u just want to test to complete click in 5 secs and hten u need to add 
        successButton.click({timeout: 5000}) and now this click should only be completed withing 5 secs and not n 2 mins
    
5 case: Suppose u know u have one slow test and it is flaky and u want to increase timeout for just particular this test
        then in pw u have one option test.slow()

        If u mark your test with this command slow() will incrase the default timeout to 3 times
        so if in config.ts file timeout: 30000 ms 

        then for below test, execution time will be 30000 * 3 = 90000 ms
        test("test name", async ({page})={
            test.slow()
        })


6 case: Suppose u want to modify test timeout for particular test suite, and u can do it in beforeEach hook

test.beforeEach(aync ({page}, testInfo) => {
   await page.goTo();
   testInfo.setTimeout(testInfo.timeout +  30000 )
})

and this will modify default timeout for complete one suite i.e. spec file


- Navigation Timeout

Navigation timeout the same thing.
Navigation timeout is how long playwright will navigate to the certain page and load this page.

This timeout is also not configured by default and limited by the test timeout.

- Expect Timeout

Expect timeout is the time limit for expect locator assertions.

The default value is five seconds and I remind you that only locator assertions has a timeout because
the generic assertion or general assertion they don't have timeout and they don't wait for anything.

So again expect timeout cannot be configured longer than a test timeout because the higher level timeout
has higher priority.

By default expect timeout is 5 secs for locators
But if u want to increase it , then in config file u can do like below, but that will be applied to all expects in all tests
in all specs in framework

export default defineConfig({

    // timeout: 20000,
  
    // globalTimeout: 90000,
  
    expect: {
      timeout: 10000,
    },
     
And if u wnat to just increase expect for particlar step in particular test then  u can override the default timeout

await expect ().toHaveText("text", {timeout: 40000});

but this expect timeout should be completed within test timeout else it will throw error.

Note: action, navgation and expect timeout are subset of test timeout and they can't override test timeout and must be completed within
      test timeout.
