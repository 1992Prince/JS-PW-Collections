Timeouts in Playwright

Timeouts in PW have 3 layer design and dependency

outer layer - Global timeout
Time limit for whole test run
default : no timeout

    - Global timeout is the time limit of the whole test run.

    - It means that if you have multiple tests, let's say ten tests in your test suite, global timeout is
      the total duration of the time for the entire test run execution.

    - If the global timeout, for example, set for two minutes and if your entire test suite runs longer
      than two minutes, then the test will be terminated based on the timeout by default.

    - Global timeout is not configured and if you want to configure it, you absolutely can do this.



Test Timeout
default: 30 secs or 30000 ms
    The next layer of the timeout is a test timeout, which is under a global timeout test.
    This is Time limit for the single test
