/**
 * ‚úÖ What is ECMAScript?
 * ECMAScript (ES) is the standard/specification that defines how JavaScript should work.
 * 
 * JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript specification.
 * Created by ECMA International.
 * Different versions are like: ES5, ES6, ES7... etc.
 * Browsers and JavaScript engines (like V8) follow this standard to run JS code.
 * 
 * üó£Ô∏è Interview line:
 * "ECMAScript is the specification or standard behind JavaScript. 
 * It defines the rules, syntax, and features of the language. 
 * JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript."
 * 
 * üï∞Ô∏è Pre-ES6 (Before 2015)
 * üü° ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and below
 *      Released in 2009
 *      Supported by all major browsers
 *      Only had:
 *              var for variables
 *              No classes, no arrow functions, no modules
 *              Basic OOP using prototypes
 *              Manual workarounds for async code (like callbacks)
 * 
 * ‚ö° ES6 and After (ES2015+)
 * üü¢ Major update in 2015 ‚Äî ES6 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 2015)
 * Added modern, cleaner syntax & powerful features:
 * | Feature            | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `let`, `const`     | Block-scoped variables         |
| Arrow functions    | Short syntax for functions     |
| Classes            | Class-based OOP                |
| Template literals  | `${}` interpolation in strings |
| Destructuring      | Easy object/array unpacking    |
| Modules (`import`) | Modular JS support             |
| Promises           | Better async handling          |
| Default params     | Function default arguments     |

‚úÖ Interview-Ready Answer:

"ECMAScript is the official standard or specification that defines how JavaScript should work. 
JavaScript follows this ECMAScript standard, which is maintained by ECMA International."

"Now if we talk about ES5 vs ES6 ‚Äî 

ES5 (released in 2009) was widely supported and introduced things like strict mode, array methods 
like forEach, map, filter, and JSON support. But it still had some limitations ‚Äî 
like only var for variable declarations, no classes, and no native support for modules or promises."

"ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, was a major update to the language. 
It introduced modern and cleaner syntax ‚Äî like let and const for block-scoped variables, 
arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, default parameters, 
promises, and module imports/exports. 
It made JavaScript more readable, maintainable, and powerful."

"So overall, ES6 made JavaScript development much more modern and developer-friendly compared to ES5."
